        <p>
            Recall that the key to understanding the rate of change interpretation of the derivative is to use the particular formulation
            <me>
                f'(a)=\lim\limits_{b\to a}\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
            </me>,
            and to interpret the difference quotient 
            <men xml:id="eq_avg_rate">
                \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
            </men>
            as the <em>average rate of change</em> of <m>f</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. The idea is that as <m>b\to a</m>, the <em>average</em> rate of change computed as by <xref ref="eq_avg_rate"/> gets closer and closer to an <em>instantaneous</em> rate of change of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>. This is the motivation behind the definition of instantaneous rate of change given in <xref ref="d_der_interpretations"/>.

                    Suppose quantity <m>q</m> is modeled as a function <m>q=f(s)</m> of some other quantity <m>s</m>. Roughly speaking, the derivative
