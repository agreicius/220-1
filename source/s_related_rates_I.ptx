    <title>Related rates I</title>
    <p>
        Any time two functions are related via an equation, we can <em>deduce</em> an equation involving those functions and their derivatives by taking the derivative of both sides. When doing empirical modeling, this simple observation allows us to take an established relationship between two quantities and deduce a relationship between the rates of change of these quantities. This type of argument is at the heart of so-called <em>related rates</em> problems. Our example with the inflatable balloon provides a particularly easy introduction to this method, as here one quantity (volume) can be expressed entirely in terms of the other: in other words, the starting relation here is just a formula. 
    </p>
    <example xml:id="eg_balloon">
    <title>Inflating a balloon (redux)</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
        The volume <m>V</m> (in cm<m>^3</m>) of a spherical inflatable balloon is computed as <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>, where <m>r</m> is the radius of the balloon (in cm). 
    </p>
    <p>
        What is the rate of change at time <m>t_0</m>, assuming that the volume at this point is <m>36000 \pi</m> and the rate of inflation at <m>t_0</m> is <m>0.05</m> cm per s?

        The next example is more involved as now the relationship between the relevant quantities is not directly given in terms of a formula.

    <example xml:id="eg_sliding_ladder">
    <title>Sliding ladder</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    A ladder of length 5 meters leans against a vertical wall; the base of the ladder lies 3 meters from the wall. An unfortunate nudge from passerby Dudley causes the base to slide away from the wall at a rate of 1.25 m/s. How quickly is the top of the ladder sliding towards the floor at this moment?

             The following steps are useful for modeling and solving a related rates problem.

                                Clearly define and name all important quantities in the problem. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            Constant or static quantities should be assigned either a constant symbol or an explicit value.

                                    </li>

                                            Varying quantities should be modeled as functions of a common input quantity. Denote these quantities using function notation, taking care to define what the input variable is.

                                            A careful drawing, labeled using the function names we've introduced, often clarifies the role of different quantities in the problem.

                                Identify what the problem is asking us to compute in terms of the function notation introduced in Step 1a. We are almost always interested in some <em>rate of change</em>, and this should be expressed as the derivative of one of the functions we defined, or a specific value of that derivative.  
                            </p>

                             Establish an equation that <em>relates</em> the various functions we are interested in.

                                        This should be an equation relating <em>functions</em> of some common variable. As such this equation will look like a function identity.

                                        A careful drawing, labeled using the function names we've introduced, will often help to derive this equation.

                                From the equation you established in Step 1d, derive a new equation that relates the derivative you are interested in with known values of functions and/or derivatives of those functions. This usually amounts to computing the derivative of both sides of the original equation.
