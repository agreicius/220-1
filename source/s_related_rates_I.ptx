    <title>Related rates I</title>
    <p>
        Any time two functions are related via an equation, we can <em>deduce</em> an equation involving those functions and their derivatives by taking the derivative of both sides. When doing empirical modeling, this simple observation allows us to take an established relationship between two quantities and deduce a relationship between the rates of change of these quantities. This type of argument is at the heart of so-called <em>related rates</em> problems. Our example with the inflatable balloon provides a particularly easy introduction to this method, as here one quantity (volume) can be expressed entirely in terms of the other: in other words, the starting relation here is just a formula. 
    </p>
    <example xml:id="eg_balloon">
    <title>Inflating a balloon (redux)</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
        The volume <m>V</m> (in cm<m>^3</m>) of a spherical inflatable balloon is computed as <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>, where <m>r</m> is the radius of the balloon (in cm). 
    </p>
    <p>
        What is the rate of change at time <m>t_0</m>, assuming that the volume at this point is <m>36000 \pi</m> and the rate of inflation at <m>t_0</m> is <m>0.05</m> cm per s?
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
            <p>
                Letting <m>V(t)</m> and <m>r(t)</m> be the volume and radius of the balloon after <m>t</m> seconds, we have 
                <men xml:id="eq_volume_balloon">
                    V(t)=\frac{4}{3}\pi (r(t))^3
                </men>
                and hence 
                <men xml:id="eq_volume_balloon_der">
                    V'(t)=4\pi\, r(t)^2\,  r'(t)
                </men>.
                It follows that the rate of change of volume <m>t_0</m> seconds after inflating is 
                <me>
                    V'(t_0)=4\pi \, r(t_0)^2\, r'(t_0)
                </me>.
                We are told that <m>r'(t_0)=0.05=1/20</m>. Thus it remains only to determine <m>r(t_0)</m>, the radius of the balloon at this time. We can derive this from the given fact that <m>V(t_0)=36000\pi</m>. Indeed, we have 
                <me>
                    r(t_0)^3=\frac{3}{4}V(t_0)/\pi=27000
                </me>,
                or <m>r(t_0)=30</m> cm. We conclude that 
                <me>
                    V'(t_0)=4\pi \, r(t_0)^2\,  r'(t_0)=4\pi (30)^2\cdot \frac{1}{20}=180 \pi \text{cm^3 per second}
                </me>.
                That is, at time <m>t_0</m> the volume is increasing at a rate of <m>180\pi</m> cm<m>^3</m> per second.
            </p>

        The next example is more involved as now the relationship between the relevant quantities is not directly given in terms of a formula.

    <title>Sliding ladder</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    A ladder of length 5 meters leans against a vertical wall; the base of the ladder lies 3 meters from the wall. An unfortunate nudge from passerby Dudley causes the base to slide away from the wall at a rate of 1.25 m/s. How quickly is the top of the ladder sliding towards the floor at this moment?

        <mrow>b'(0) \amp = \frac{5}{4} \text{ m/s}</mrow>
    </md>,
    and we wish to compute <m>h'(0)</m>. Taking the derivative of both sides of <xref ref="eq_sliding_ladder_ht"/>, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>2b(t)b'(t)+2h(t)h'(t) \amp =0</mrow>
        <mrow>h'(t) \amp = -\frac{b(t)b'(t)}{h(t)}</mrow>

     and thus 
     <me>
        h'(0)=-\frac{b(0)b'(0)}{h(0)}=-\frac{3\cdot(5/4)}{h(0)}
     </me>.
     It remains to compute <m>h(0)</m>. Evaluating <xref ref="eq_sliding_ladder_ht"/> at <m>t=0</m>, we see that 
     <me>
        h(0)^2+9=25

        h'(0)=-\frac{15/4}{4}=-\frac{15}{16} \text{ m/s}

     In plain English, at the moment of the nudge the top of the ladder slides toward the ground at a rate of <m>15/16</m> meters per second.
