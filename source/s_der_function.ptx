       Whereas previously we focused on the notion of the derivative of a function <m>f</m> at a specific input, we now switch perspectives somewhat and consider the derivative operation as defining a function <m>f'</m> associated to <m>f</m>.

    <title>Derivative function</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be a function, and let <m>D\subseteq \R</m> be the set of points where <m>f</m> is differentiable. The derivative operation defines a function 
    <md>
        <mrow>f'\colon D \amp\rightarrow \R </mrow>

    <p>
        Note that the domain of the derivative function <m>f'</m> need not be the entire domain of <m>f</m>: indeed, by definition it consists precisely of the points where <m>f</m> is differentiable. The next example illustrates this.

                Take an element <m>x\in (-\infty, 5]</m> in the domain of <m>f</m> and compute:
                <md>
                    <mrow>\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{\sqrt{5-(x+h)}-\sqrt{5-x}}{h}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp =\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{\sqrt{5-(x+h)}-\sqrt{5-x}}{h}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{5-(x+h)}+\sqrt{5-x}}{\sqrt{5-(x+h)}+\sqrt{5-x}}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{5-(x+h)-(5-x)}{h(\sqrt{5-(x+h)}+\sqrt{5-x})}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{-h}{h(\sqrt{5-(x+h)}+\sqrt{5-x})}</mrow>

                </md>.
                We now note that for all <m>x\in (-\infty, 5)</m>, this last limit expression evaluates to <m>-\frac{1}{2\sqrt{5-x}}</m>, after the application of simple limit rules. Thus <m>f</m> is differentiable for such elements. For <m>x=5</m>, however, the last limit becomes 
                <me>
                    \lim\limits_{h\to 0}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{-h}}
                </me>
                which is a limit of type <m>c/\infty</m>, and hence infinite. In particular the limit doesn't exist for <m>x=5</m>, showing that <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>5</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We conclude that the domain of <m>f'</m> is <m>D=(-\infty, 5)</m>. Note that <m>D</m> is strictly smaller than the domain of <m>f</m> in this case: indeed, it is every element of the domain of <m>f</m> with the exception of <m>5</m>.

        Using the slope interpretation of the derivative, we can begin to see how the derivative function <m>f'</m> implies information about the original function <m>f</m>, and conversely. 
    </p>
    <remark>
        <title>Slope interpretation</title>
        <p>
        Let <m>D</m> be the set of points where <m>f</m> is differentiable, and let <m>f'\colon D\rightarrow \R</m> be the derivative of <m>f</m>. Given any <m>x\in D</m>, we have the following equivalences:
        <md>
            <mrow>f'(x)&gt; 0 \amp \iff \text{slope of tangent line to } f \text{ at } a \text{ is positive} </mrow>
            <mrow>f'(x)&lt; 0 \amp \iff \text{slope of tangent line to } f \text{ at } a \text{ is negative} </mrow>
            <mrow>f'(x)=0 \amp \iff \text{tangent line to } f \text{ at } a \text{ is horizontal} </mrow>
        </md>.
        We will elaborate further on these equivalences when we discuss the rate of change interpretation of the derivative in more detail.

    <title>Failing to be differentiable</title>
    <p>
        By definition, a function <m>f</m> fails to be differentiable at an input <m>a</m> if the limit <xref ref="eq_der_at_point_h"/> does not exist. The precise reason for that failure to exist is reflected in the graph of <m>f</m>, using the slope of tangent line interpretation of the derivative. Some examples and their graphical analogues: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <title>Infinite limit <m>\iff</m> vertical slope</title>
                <p>
                    If the limit <xref ref="eq_der_at_point_h"/> is infinite at <m>a</m>, then the tangent line to the curve at <m>a</m> (if it exists) is vertical: <ie/>, its slope is undefined.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This evident in the graph of <m>f(x)=\sqrt{5-x}</m>. (See <xref ref="fig_graph_radical"/>.) As <m>x\to 5</m>, <m>f'(x)\to -\infty</m>; equivalently, the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x</m>, get arbitrarily large and negative. At <m>x=5</m> itself, the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> is in fact the vertical line <m>x=5</m>.
                </p>

                <title>Jump discontinuity <m>\iff</m> <q>corner point</q></title>
                <p>
                   If the limit <xref ref="eq_der_at_point_h"/> at <m>a</m> doesn't exist because of a discrepancy between the left- and right-hand limits, both of which exist, then we typically see the slope of tangent lines at points <m>x</m> to the left of <m>a</m> approaching one limiting slope, while the slope of tangent lines of points <m>x</m> to the right of <m>a</m> will approach another value. Geometrically, such a point will look like a corner or kink in the graph of <m>f</m>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The classic illustration of this phenomenon is the absolute value function <m>f(x)=\abs{x}</m>. As we show in <xref ref="eg_der_funct_abs"/> this function is differentiable everywhere except at <m>x=0</m>. Graphically we see why this is the case in the corner nature of the point <m>P=(0,0)</m> on the graph: to the left the slope of the graph is <m>-1</m>; and to the right the slope is <m>1</m>.

                <title>Wild oscillation</title>
                <p>
                    If a function is wildly oscillating near an input <m>a</m> to such a degree that limit of of <m>f</m> doesn't exist at <m>a</m>, then it turns out that the derivative also cannot exist at <m>a</m>. See the point at <m>x=d</m> for the function with graph in <xref ref="fig_limit_naive"/> as an example.

        We end this section by introducing an alternative notation for denoting the derivative of a function. The notation is called <em>Leibniz notation</em>, as it was favored in Gottlieb Leibniz's development of calculus. Isaac Newton, on the other hand favored the prime notation <m>f'</m>. Leibniz notation comes in very handy when considering the derivative as an <em>operation</em> that we apply to functions; it also strongly evokes the interpretation of the interpretation of the derivative as a rate of change. It is very much less convenient as an alternative notation for <m>f'(a)</m>, as exhibited by <xref ref="eq_Leib_at_point"/>.
