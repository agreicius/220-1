    <theorem xml:id="th_rolles">
        <title>Rolle's theorem</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            Assume <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>. If <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>, then there is an input <m>c\in [a,b]</m> satisfying <m>f'(c)=0</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>C=f(a)=f(b)</m> be the common value of <m>f</m> at the endpoints.  If <m>f(x)=C</m> for <em>all</em> inputs <m>x\in [a,b]</m> (<ie/>, <m>f</m> is a constant function), then <m>f'(x)=0</m> for all inputs <m>x\in (a,b)</m>, and our desired conclusion is trivially satisfied. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Assume now that <m>f</m> is not constant. Since <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> there are points <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> where <m>f</m> attains its absolute maximum and minimum values. Since <m>f</m> is not constant on <m>[a,b]</m>, we must have <m>f(c)\ne C</m> or <m>f(d)\ne C</m>. Assume without loss of generality that <m>f(c)\ne C</m> is an absolute extreme value of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>. The input <m>c</m> must be an interior point of <m>[a,b]</m>, since <m>f(c)\ne f(a)</m> and <m>f(c)\ne f(b)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is differentiable everywhere on <m>(a,b)</m>, <xref ref="th_crit_pt"/> implies <m>f'(c)=0</m>, as desired.

    <title>Interpretations of Rolle's theorem</title>
    <p>
        Let <m>f</m> satisfy the assumptions of Rolle's theorem on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Geometrically, we interpret Rolle's theorem as follows: if the endpoints of the graph of <m>f</m> over <m>[a,b]</m> lie on the same horizontal line, then there is an input <m>c\in (a,b)</m> for which the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> is horizontal.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of rate of change, we interpret Rolle's theorem as follows: if the <em>average</em> rate of change of <m>f</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is equal to zero, then there is an input <m>c\in (a,b)</m> where the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of change <m>f'(c)</m> is equal to zero. 
    </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
       Rolle's theorem turns out to be a special case of the <xref ref="th_mean_value" text="custom">mean value theorem</xref>, where the function in question satisfies <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>. As a peculiar twist, however, the mean value theorem can also be seen as just a <q>tilted</q> version of Rolle's theorem. In logical terms, the two theorems, though quite different in content, are logically equivalent!  
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_mean_value">
        <title>Mean value theorem (MVT)</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Assume <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>. There is an input <m>c\in (a,b)</m> satisfying 
                <men xml:id="eq_mean_value">
                    f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
                </men>.                
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
              We employ a little trick that reveals MVT to be a simple consequence of Rolle's theorem. Define 
              <me>
                g(x)=f(x)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{(b-a)}(x-a)
              </me>.
              As is easily verified, <m>g</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>, differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> and satisfies 
              <mdn>
                <mrow xml:id="eq_mean_g">g(a) \amp =g(b)=f(a)</mrow>
                <mrow xml:id="eq_mean_gprime">g'(x) \amp = f'(x)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{(b-a)}</mrow>
              </mdn>.
              Applying Rolle's theorem to <m>g</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, we conlude that 
              <me>
                g'(c)=0
              </me>
              for some <m>c\in (a,b)</m>. We conclude, using <xref ref="eq_mean_gprime"/> we conclude that 
              <me>
                0=f'(c)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
              </me>,
               or equivalently
               <me>
                f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
               </me>,
               as desired.

    While traveling in Ontario, Dudley pilots his motor car along Queen Elizabeth Way (aka the QEW). The posted speed limit along this stretch of motorway is 120 km per hr. At 12 pm Dudley passes St. Catherines, and by 12:25 pm he reaches Hamilton, which is 60 km down the road. Prove: at some point during this excursion Dudley has exceeded the speed limit!

        For the curious, we end with a useful corollary of the mean value theorem that yields a numerically more precise description of how good of an approximation the linearization <m>L(x)</m> of a function <m>f(x)</m> centered at <m>a</m> is for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>.
