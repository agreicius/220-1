    <theorem xml:id="th_rolles">
        <title>Rolle's theorem</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            Assume <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>. If <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>, then there is an input <m>c\in [a,b]</m> satisfying <m>f'(c)=0</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>C=f(a)=f(b)</m> be the common value of <m>f</m> at the endpoints.  If <m>f(x)=C</m> for <em>all</em> inputs <m>x\in [a,b]</m> (<ie/>, <m>f</m> is a constant function), then <m>f'(x)=0</m> for all inputs <m>x\in (a,b)</m>, and our desired conclusion is trivially satisfied. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Assume now that <m>f</m> is not constant. Since <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> there are points <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> where <m>f</m> attains its absolute maximum and minimum values. Since <m>f</m> is not constant on <m>[a,b]</m>, we must have <m>f(c)\ne C</m> or <m>f(d)\ne C</m>. Assume without loss of generality that <m>f(c)\ne C</m> is an absolute extreme value of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>. The input <m>c</m> must be an interior point of <m>[a,b]</m>, since <m>f(c)\ne f(a)</m> and <m>f(c)\ne f(b)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is differentiable everywhere on <m>(a,b)</m>, <xref ref="th_crit_pt"/> implies <m>f'(c)=0</m>, as desired.

    <title>Interpretations of Rolle's theorem</title>
    <p>
        Let <m>f</m> satisfy the assumptions of Rolle's theorem on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Geometrically, we interpret Rolle's theorem as follows: if the endpoints of the graph of <m>f</m> over <m>[a,b]</m> lie on the same horizontal line, then there is an input <m>c\in (a,b)</m> for which the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> is horizontal.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of rate of change, we interpret Rolle's theorem as follows: if the <em>average</em> rate of change of <m>f</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is equal to zero, then there is an input <m>c\in (a,b)</m> where the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of change <m>f'(c)</m> is equal to zero. 
    </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
       Rolle's theorem turns out to be a special case of the <xref ref="th_mean_value" text="custom">mean value theorem</xref>, where the function in question satisfies <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>. As a peculiar twist, however, the mean value theorem can also be seen as just a <q>tilted</q> version of Rolle's theorem. In logical terms, the two theorems, though quite different in content, are logically equivalent!  
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_mean_value">
        <title>Mean value theorem (MVT)</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Assume <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>. There is an input <m>c\in (a,b)</m> satisfying 
                <men xml:id="eq_mean_value">
                    f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}

            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
              We employ a little trick that reveals MVT to be a simple consequence of Rolle's theorem. Define 
              <me>
                g(x)=f(x)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{(b-a)}(x-a)
              </me>.
              As is easily verified, <m>g</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>, differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> and satisfies 
              <mdn>
                <mrow xml:id="eq_mean_g">g(a) \amp =g(b)=f(a)</mrow>
                <mrow xml:id="eq_mean_gprime">g'(x) \amp = f'(x)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{(b-a)}</mrow>
              </mdn>.
              Applying Rolle's theorem to <m>g</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, we conlude that 
              <me>
                g'(c)=0
              </me>
              for some <m>c\in (a,b)</m>. We conclude, using <xref ref="eq_mean_gprime"/> we conclude that 
              <me>
                0=f'(c)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
              </me>,
               or equivalently
               <me>
                f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
               </me>,
               as desired.

            <p>
                Assume <m>f</m> is continuous on an interval <m>I</m>. If <m>f</m> satisfies <m>f'(x)=0</m> for all interior points <m>x\in I</m>, then <m>f</m> is a constant function on <m>I</m>.

                Take any two distinct points <m>c,d\in I</m>. We may assume without loss of generality that <m>c&lt; d</m>. The assumptions on <m>f</m> guarantee that it is both continuous (since differentiable) on <m>[c,d]</m> and differentiable on the interior of <m>(c,d)</m>. The mean value theorem then implies that we have

                We have shown that for any <m>c,d\in I</m> we have <m>f(c)=f(d)</m>. In other words, <m>f</m> is a constant function on <m>I</m>, as desired.

    Since <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere, and satisfies <m>f(-2)&gt; 0</m> and <m>f(2)&lt; 0</m>, the intermediate value theorem implies there is an element <m>c\in [-2,2]</m> satisfying <m>f(c)=0</m>: <ie/>, <m>f</m> has at least one root <m>c\in [-2,2]</m>.

        Suppose by contradiction that <m>f</m> had two distinct roots <m>c,d\in [-2,2]</m>. Without loss of generality, we can assume <m>c&lt; d</m>. Since <m>f</m> is differentiable everywhere, the mean value theorem would imply that there exists  <m>e\in (c,d)</m> satifying

            Consider <m>h(x)=\sqrt{1+x}-(1+\frac{1}{2}x)</m>. We wish to show that <m>h(x)&lt; 0</m> for all <m>x&gt; 0</m>.

    </hint>
    <solution>
    <p>
    Let <m>h(x)=\sqrt{1+x}-(1+\frac{1}{2}x)</m>. The desired inequality is equivalent to the inequality <m>h(x)&lt; 0</m> for all <m>x&gt; 0</m>, which we now endeavor to demonstrate. First observe that <m>h'(x)&lt; 0</m> for all <m>x&gt; 0</m>. Indeed, we have
