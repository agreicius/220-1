        <p>
            Many of the questions we will study in regard to functions revolve around how the output of a function <m>f</m> changes with respect to its input. As such we want to develop useful and precise language and tools for describing this relation. The <em>limit</em> of a function, defined informally here and rigorously later, is one such tool. Before getting to its informal definition, we illustrate with an example the type of statements we wish to formalize with limit language.

        <p>Describe how the output <m>f(x)</m> behaves as the input <m>x</m> approaches each of the values <m>a,b,c,d,e</m>. For some of these values, you might consider how <m>x</m> approaches from the left and right separately.

        <solution>
            <p>
                As <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>, either from the left or right, the values <m>f(x)</m> of the function get arbitrarily large and negative. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As <m>x</m> approaches <m>b</m> from the left, the values <m>f(x)</m> of <m>f</m> get closer and closer to <m>0</m>. However, as <m>x</m> approaches <m>b</m> from the right, the values <m>f(x)</m> get closer and closer to <m>A</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> from the left or right, the values <m>f(x)</m> of the function approach the real number <m>M</m>. We also happen to have <m>f(c)=B</m>: <ie/>, the value of <m>f</m> at <m>x=c</m> is equal to <m>B</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                As <m>x</m> approaches <m>d</m> from the left, the values <m>f(x)</m> of the function approach <m>C</m>. However, as <m>x</m> approaches <m>d</m> from the right, the values <m>f(x)</m> oscillate wildly above and below <m>C</m> and do not seem to approach any single value.

            <p>
                As <m>x</m> approaches <m>e</m> from the left or right, the values <m>f(x)</m> of the function approach <m>D</m>. Interestingly, however, the actual value of <m>f</m> at the input <m>x=e</m> is not equal to <m>D</m>.

                The terms <q>greater than</q>, <q>less than</q>, <q>large</q>, and <q>larger than</q> have very particular meanings when used in mathematics. This can be a significant source of confusion, in part because some of those terms are roughly synonymous in vernacular English. Let us disambiguate.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <title>Greater than</title>

                            We say that the real number <m>x</m> is greater than <m>y</m> if <m>x&gt; y</m>. In terms of location on the real line, being greater than simply means lying to the right of: <ie/> <m>x</m> is greater than <m>y</m> if and only if <m>x</m> lies to the right of <m>y</m> on the number line. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Less than</title>
                        <p>
                            We say that the real number <m>x</m> is less than <m>y</m> if <m>x&lt; y</m>. In terms of location on the real line, being less than simply means lying to the left of: <ie/> <m>x</m> is less than <m>y</m> if and only if <m>x</m> lies to the left of <m>y</m> on the number line. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Large, larger than</title>
                        <p>
                            We say that a real number <m>x</m> is large if its <em>distance</em> to the origin is large: <ie/>, if its absolute value <m>\abs{x}</m> is a large positive number. Consequently, a number <m>x</m> is larger than a number <m>y</m> if the absolute value of <m>x</m> is greater than the absolute value of <m>y</m>: <ie/>, <m>x</m> is larger than <m>y</m> if <m>\abs{x}&gt; \abs{y}</m>.

                        <p>
                            Thus, according to our definition <m>-3</m> is larger than <m>1</m> (since <m>\abs{-3}=3 &gt; \abs{1}=1</m>) even though <m>-3</m> is less than <m>1</m>.

                    Suppose <m>f</m> is a function defined everywhere on an open interval containing the point <m>a\in \R</m>, except possibly at <m>a</m> itself. We say that the <term>limit</term> of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> exists if there is a value <m>L</m> such that the function value <m>f(x)</m> can be made arbitrarily close to <m>L</m> provided <m>x</m> is sufficiently close (but not equal) to <m>a</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this is the case, we call <m>L</m> the limit of <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> and write

                <p>
                    The limit <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)</m> does not exist. There is no value <m>L</m> that <m>f(x)</m> approaches for inputs <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>a</m>. Indeed, as <m>x</m> gets arbitrarily close to <m>a</m>, <m>f(x)</m> becomes arbitrarily large and negative.

                    The limit <m>\lim\limits_{x\to b}f(x)</m> does not exist. If <m>x</m> is arbitrarily close to <m>b</m>, and less than <m>b</m> (to the left), then the values <m>f(x)</m> gets arbitrarily close to <m>0</m>; thus if the limit existed it would have to be equal to <m>0</m>. And yet for inputs <m>x</m> arbitrarily close to <m>b</m> but greater than <m>b</m> (to the right), the values <m>f(x)</m> are greater than <m>1</m>: <ie/>, they get no closer than a distance of <m>1</m> from the value <m>0</m>.

                    We have <m>\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=B</m>. Since <m>B=f(c)</m>, we have <m>\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)</m> in this case.
