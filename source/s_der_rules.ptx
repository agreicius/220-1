    <title>Differentiation rules</title>
<p>
    We now examine how the operation of taking the derivative of a function interacts with our basic function operations: <eg/>, scalar multiplication, addition, multiplication, and quotients. We will make heavy use of the Leibniz notation <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m>, which denotes the operation of taking the derivative with respect to <m>x</m>. In this context we will either write <m>\frac{d}{dx}(f)</m>, where <m>f</m> is the name of a function, or else <m>\frac{d}{dx}(\text{blah})</m>, where <c>blah</c> denotes some expression in <m>x</m>. In the latter case, the expression in question is understood to define a function, with the usual implied domain convention. Thus for example <m>\frac{d}{dx}(5)</m> denotes the derivative of the constant function <m>f(x)=5</m>; and <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x)</m> denotes the derivative of the identity function <m>f(x)=x</m>.

<p>
 In fact, it is true more generally that for any power function <m>f(x)=x^r</m>, where <m>r\in \R</m> is a fixed real number, we have <m>f'(x)=rx^{r-1}</m>. Since we do not even define what the expression <m>x^r</m> means for arbitrary real number <m>r</m> until Math 220-2, however, we will not make much use of this formula unless <m>r</m> is a rational number as in <xref ref="th_der_formula_rat_power"/>.
