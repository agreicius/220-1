<div class="para">A <em class="emphasis">logistic function</em> is often used to model a quantity <span class="process-math">\(Q=f(t)\)</span> whose growth is prevented from being unlimited by some external factors. These functions are used, for example, to model the growth of a population, or the growth of sales of a product. Below you find the graph of this type of function.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/fig_logistic_growth-2.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Graph of logistic growth function"></div>

<li><div class="para">The function <span class="process-math">\(Q(t)\)</span> is increasing on its entire domain, with a horizontal asymptote of <span class="process-math">\(y=L\text{,}\)</span> meaning that <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{t\to \infty}Q(t)=L\text{.}\)</span> This means the quantity <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is always growing, approaches a ceiling value of <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> but never reaches that value. (The value <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> in a logistic function like this is called the <dfn class="terminology">carrying capacity</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> in modeling contexts.)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">As always, the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is the derivative function <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dQ}{dt}=Q'(t)\text{.}\)</span>  We see that for <span class="process-math">\(t\in [0,t_2]\)</span> the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is positive, and gets more positive as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> increases. This means that <span class="process-math">\(Q'(t)\)</span> is positive and increasing. In terms of <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> this means that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is increasing <em class="emphasis">at an increasing rate</em> over this interval.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Similar reasoning shows that for <span class="process-math">\(t\in [t_2, t_6]\)</span> the rate of change <span class="process-math">\(Q'(t)\)</span> is positive but getting less positive (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(Q'\)</span> is decreasing). In terms of <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> this means that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is increasing <em class="emphasis">at a decreasing rate</em> over this interval. This makes sense in terms of the limiting value <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{:}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> cannot exceed this value, its rate of increase must level off as it gets closer in value to <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">It appears that <span class="process-math">\(Q(t_2)=\frac{L}{2}\text{.}\)</span> As it turns out, this is a special property that holds for all logistic functions. In more detail, our previous analysis identifies <span class="process-math">\(t_2\)</span> as the unique inflection point of the function <span class="process-math">\(Q(t)\text{.}\)</span> (See <a href="s_concavity.html#d_concav_inflect" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/d_concav_inflect.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Definition 23.3: Concavity and inflection points">DefinitionÂ 23.3</a>.) In the modeling context <span class="process-math">\(t_2\)</span> is sometimes called a <dfn class="terminology">point of diminishing returns</dfn>, since the rate of increase of <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> levels off after that point. It turns out that for any logistic function the value of the function at this point in time is always equal to <span class="process-math">\(L/2\text{,}\)</span> half of the carrying capacity <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">This property of logistic functions is useful for predicting the ceiling value of a quantity you are studying. Imagine you take daily measurements of a growing population of bacteria that you believe is accurately modeled by a logistic function. From that data you can compute the <em class="emphasis">average rate of change</em> over each day, which you interpret as an <em class="emphasis">estimate</em> of the <em class="emphasis">instantaneous rate of change</em> of growth each day. On the first day that you notice your rate of growth estimate has decreased from the previous day, you conclude that you have reached (approximately) the point of diminishing returns. If the population on that day is <span class="process-math">\(Q_0\text{,}\)</span> you estimate that the ceiling of the population is <span class="process-math">\(2Q_0\text{.}\)</span>
